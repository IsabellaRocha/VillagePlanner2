# VillagePlanner2

About VillagePlanner:
  Currently, the process to navigate a trip to the USC village is extremely complicated. With so many options of restaurants, shops, and activities to choose from, people are often overwhelmed. In addition, there are so many students, faculty, and neighboring residents that frequent these stores, that wait times and checkout lines can be very long. To improve efficiency, lessen confusion, and increase customer satisfaction, Yannan Li has tasked a development team to create “Village Planner”.
  This application will allow visitors at USC Village to organize their trip village as efficiently as possible.
